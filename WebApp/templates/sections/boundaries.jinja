		<h>Statements of fact regarding Furnace Farm House Boundaries</h>
		<ol>
			<li>
				It is a requirement for the Owner of Furnace Farm House (quoted as the Purchaser) to maintain a a 3ft 6 inches high driven spile fence, along all boundaries marked T in the attached map  
				<div class="image-pair">

					</figure>
				</div>
			</li>

			<li>
				As can be noted by the map broadly speaking all excluding the irregular knob in the north-west corner all boundaries of the property are marked with a T therefore creating the obligation for the Farmhouse owner to build and maintain said fence
			</li>

			<li>
				The FHO for at least the Last decade continuously have been content for the occupiers of Furnace Farm to instead maintain the boundaries.
				<ol>
					<li>The subsequently erected fence has been of a height of approximately 1.9m far below the maximum allowance of 2m for a domestic fence before planning is required.</li>
					<li>The construction of the fence are simple treated apple stakes with stock wire on the bottom meter and chicken wire on the top portion. Previous owners possessed a pair of large hunting dogs capable of jumping 4ft with ease.</li>
					<li>This has removed the financial and/or time burden from The FHO</li>
					<li>The erection of said fence does not restrict the FHO from constructing their own fence either abutting or further in from the boundary; or other wise planting a hedge, shrubs or using some other visual barrier to create a more visually appealing boundary should they desire.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

			<li>
				For the majority of the length of the fence forming the boundary between Furnace Farm and Furnace Farm House there is various hedging all owned and maintained by the occupiers of Furnace Farm.
				<ul>
					<li>Alder from the  South-East corner around to the half way along the West boundary.</li>
					<li>Laurel in the North half of the West Boundary</li>
					<li>
						The hedge is comprised of hawthorn from the North-West corner around to the South-East corner.
						It is from these specimens that the offending cuttings were take as can be evidenced by then noticeable red fruit or haws

					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				It has from time to time been a requirement for the occupiers of furnace farm to access the title of Furnace Farm House to maintain the boundary fence.
			</li>

			<li>
				On some occasions That maintenance includes cutting large woody growth that may grow through the fence and cause damage. Large growth may also cause nuisance or a burden of cost in cutting to the FHO.
			</li>

			<li>
				Under previous versions of ownership permission to do said maintenance works could easily be acquired via knocking on the door of FFH and directly requesting permission from the occupants.
				<ul>
					<li>Under previous versions of ownership it has not always been necessary to confer with the owner/occupier of FFH to enter onto the land and undertake regular maintenance works that do not cause intrusion or nuisance.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					under previous ownerships it has been acceptable to enter onto the garden to undertake necessary maintenance when the house is unoccupied (as it has from time to time been due to its status as a weekend home)
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				during the approximately 18 months preceding NHB Investments ownership of FFH no significant gardening work had taken place resulting in a large volume of unchecked growth from the hedges located on the title of Furnace farm onto that of Furnace Farmn house
			</li>

			<li>
				At the time of entrance onto the title known as Furnace Farm House the hawthorn hedge had grown so freely that portions of the hedge were in actual physical contact with the North building fabric of Furnace Farm House and had done so for some time
				<p>This can be evidenced by the marketing photographs produced for Marketing of FFH over the summer period.</p>

				<h>Other important points of note</h>
			</li>

			<li>
				agents doing works to FFH had been consulted and stated that the managers of the property did not wish for any works to be done to the property beyond those the agents were already being commissioned to do on an approximately by weekly basis. This can be evidenced by audio recording A.
				<ul>
					<li>Gardeners confirmed they did not know how to contact Owners of FFH.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Hawthorns in the late summer and autumn months have unique fruit called a haw.</li>
				<li>Haws are a well known food of the grey squirrel which is abundant in the Kent country side especially in highly wooded ares such as the surrounding areas of Bedgebury Forest where Furnace Farm House is situated</li>
				<li>grey squirrels are recorded to actively seek out and consume lead.</li>
				<li>Lewis, R. J. (2015). Consumption of Metallic Lead and its Effects on Tissue (conference paper / proceedings). aptly summarizes the abundant documentation of this behavior in it's introduction and further references (McKinnon et al. 1976, Lewis et al. 2001, Pokras and Kneeland 2008) as sources</li>
				<li>Furnace Farm House has abundance of lead flashing to help stop the ingress of water into the building</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>

		<h>Timeline</h>
		<p>
			Occupiers of furnace farm are unable to give a timeline of exact dates as works undertaken were executed under the form of general maintenance that are performed on an annual recurring basis.
			As such no documentation noting dates of works or hours spent were documented nor were any photographs taken as there were no reasons to imagine their requirement.
			As such any timeline can only provide a rough indication of the sequence of events but not their precise moments in time.

		<h>Conclusions</h>
		<ol>
			<li>The property title of Furnace Farm House was entered onto by agents of FF.</li>
			<li>Works were done to undertake regular maintenance to the North and Eastern hedges surrounding the property where large growths had grown over and through the boundary fence.</li>
			<li>Had the works not been done there would have been an increased chance of damage being caused to FFH caused by the proximity of the hawthorn hedging haws and the leading of FFS. And due to the general nature of the leaning branches being a cause of access to the building for squirrels and other rodents.</li>
			<li>some of the cuttings were left on the property of FFH for a short but exact period unknown before being relocated onto FF as evidenced by figure n.1 (the top photo on the A4 page labelled n) provided by NHS investments notice of intent to claim.</li>
			<li>
				It is claimed and corroborated by figure n.2 provided by NHS ice of intent to claim that some cuttings were left on the access to FFH on the track that forms a part of the title of FF but over which FFH has a right of way.
				<ul>
					<li>agents of FF have no recollection of leaving cuttings in this location.</li>
					<li>The cutting identified in figure n.2 were removed by agents of FF once they had come to their attention.</li>
					<li>cuttings were relatively light and could easily have been moved by hand with minimal effort in order to gain access to FFH by light vehicle.</li>
					<li>cuttings were sufficiently small as to have been no obstruction for large vehicles to drive over.</li>
					<li>cuttings were no obstruction to users of the access of FFH that approached by foot (Which seemed to be the most common practice).</li>
				</ul>
